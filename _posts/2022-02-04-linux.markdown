I have recently used the Linux operating system as a development environment and I realised just how convenient it is to download softwares on it. It takes me literally 10mins to set up a development environment on Linux, whereas I would always have to fumble over the multitude of installation steps in windows. When installing software on windows, I would often find myself having to configure settings that I'm not even sure about, and at the end of the installation, the software often doesn't work how I expect it to work and I would have to trouble shoot to find out the issue. However on Linux, it's as easy as typing a command on the command line and there are minimal manual configurations to be done.

That being said, I will be setting up my development environment on Windows Subsystem for Linux from now onwards.
